# Keyboard blog - initial thoughts

#### *Samuel Roeca*

## Introduction

This document contains thoughts about a blog about keyboards. Ultimately, I'm interested in learning the Flask web framework, so I want to get something on the internet. However, I'm finding that it's hard to get anything up without content. Therefore, I'm picking one of my interests (keyboards) as content.

## Possible content

1. A "keyboard consumer" blog.
  * I have no experience building keyboards of my own
* Covers only those keyboards I deem worth writing about.
  * I may organize them according to style, and come up cool rankings
* Rants section about typing in general
  * Future of computer communication, etc
* Discussion about keyboard layout in general / text editors
  * vi bindings, and editors that support them

## Site features

1. Consistent theme across articles that is easy to maintain
* Easy navigation
  * Consider what information people are looking for
* Comments section for each article
  * Moderation ability in case of trolls
* Contact me (if so desired)
* Advertising, but unobtrusive
* Potential for guest postings
  * Leave open this possibility, not essential for initial release
