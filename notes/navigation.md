# Navigation

Navigation within a website poses an interesting problem. Do we embed information about links and site locations within HTML / Templates, or do we place this information within our Python code?

## [Flask-Nav](http://pythonhosted.org/flask-nav/)

The above package provides a good, Python-level interface with a navigation bar. I will spend tomorrow getting some basic navigation in place, with a root-level template and views that simplify everything. Apparently, Flask Bootstrap provides a [good interface](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/nav.html) as well, so maybe I'll try fiddling with this. 

Ultimately, I think getting a proper navigation bar is an important step toward having a solid blog.
