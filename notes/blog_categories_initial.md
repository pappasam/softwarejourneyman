# Blog categories

I have many interests, and this blog will attempt to funnel them into something productive.

## Categories

### Avoidable bugs

Technical blog; bugs I've found, and their workarounds

### Acceptable tools

This can be a list of free programming tools that can be helpful for others. The Linux community is wonderful, but hard to break into at first. Maybe a series of directional posts can help get people in the right direction. Can discuss anything to make one more productive in software development, including Keyboards

### Human error

Potentially controversial opinions about project management. This lets me rant while organizing more useful content in its own place (other categories).

### About me

This section organizes all other categories, and provides an "About Me" section
