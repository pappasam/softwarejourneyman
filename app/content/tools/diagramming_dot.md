title: A diagram in a thousand words

How do you explain a system to other developers before any code has been written? If code is being written, how to you ensure each developer remembers the big picture, and can revise it when necessary? After a system has been built, how do you introduce a non-technical person to your system's raison d'Ãªtre?

One solution I've often witnessed is dry prose. A developer might create a long, dry text file and forward it as an attachment with no email header. During an on-boarding meeting, he might point out that he sent an email and that he's ready for questions. The non-technical person then might ask, "Can you explain what you mean here in the second line by 'class inheritance'?" It becomes clear this is the meeting from hell. No resolutions are drawn, everyone's time was wasted, and the non-technical participant concludes he hates working with engineers. After three more prose-filled meetings, the project begins, crashes, and burns three weeks later.

The correct solution would obviously have been to draw a picture. If the developer had drawn a diagram connecting concepts and walked the team through each point, the non-technical person would probably have noticed that the first box said "XML feed expected from **Company A**". They might then have pointed out that Company A is undergoing litigation with Company C, rendering their input unattainable because of gremlins. Non-technical participants are often the only people in the room aware of political blockers, and by making technical content accessible through a diagram, it becomes much easier to obtain necessary input.

## Why you no draw picture?

If people appreciate diagrams so much, why are diagrams so often an afterthought in software development? Why can't developers just keep their diagrams up to date with their code? My guess is that developers don't keep their diagrams up to date because most diagrams are not generated with a text editor. Most people associate diagrams with presentation software, and this software is often owned, marketed, and controlled by large corporations. Worse, they almost never enable developers to generate diagrams from that most-important tool: the text editor. After meditating on the subject for a while, I realized that the role of a separate application in diagram generation was poison for my creation of diagrams. If I had to leave the terminal to generate a diagram, I'd probably just resign myself to cryptic text files and whiteboarding.

## Solution: diagram through code!

Luckily, several months ago, I had a discussion with a budding young project manager. He mentioned that a developer he'd worked with made awesome diagrams, and that he did this through source code. The source files ended in *.dot*, and this guy swore by them for conveying the meaning of his code. This discussion sparked a weekend of searching and experimenting, and I discovered the DOT language.

## DOT language

### Introduction

The [DOT language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) is programming language, written in a C-like syntax, that compiles to a diagram. It is not particularly hard to use, but finding it was quite the challenge. I've provided two very useful links for you to read more about the language and get started with it. The language documentation is thorough, and pretty much all you're going to get on the subject. DOT language is very well-documented, but your only documentation is in the PDF below.

### Example

My prose about the DOT language is probably fascinating, but I figure an example will help send home the possibilities of this language as a diagramming tool. See below for an example of the DOT language. See below for the rendered image, which shows three groups: Outsiders, the Software Kingdom, and the Land of users. There is no logic to the image itself, but it looks fairly logical. I could probably explain why both Patent Trolls and Breakthroughs are attracted to noobs, but in all honestly, I created this diagram with little thought beyond trying to show the number of shapes and colors one can quickly put together.

The image is certainly colorful. With a little imagination, I'm sure you can see yourself putting the content of your software projects in this kind of form. I'm sure it will be much more logical than what I put together. Although the above image is cool, what is cooler (to me) is that everything was generated with the following code:

    :::python
    digraph kingdom_danger {
        rankdir=LR; // Diagram goes from left to right
        node [shape=hexagon style=filled fillcolor=cornsilk color=black];

        /*These are
          my outsiders
          */
        OUT1 [label="Outsider 1"];
        OUT2 [label="Outsider 2"];

        // This is a cluster representing the perils and joy of software
        subgraph cluster_software_kingdom {
            label = "Software Kingdom" style=filled;
            fillcolor=peachpuff color=black;
            node [shape=trapezium];
            SGF [label="Segfault" fillcolor=lightgray];
            BTR [label="Breakthrough" fillcolor=orangered];
            PTN [label="Patent Troll" fillcolor=plum];
        }

        // All users gather here, and bask in your freedom
        subgraph cluster_users {
            label = "Land of users" style=filled;
            fillcolor=gainsboro color=black;
            node [shape=doublecircle];
            HKR [label="Hacker" fillcolor=seagreen];
            NOB [label="Noob" fillcolor=royalblue];
            GMR [label="Gamer" fillcolor=purple];
        }

        // Relationships between outsiders and the kingdom
        OUT1 -> BTR;
        OUT1 -> PTN;
        OUT2 -> SGF;

        // Kingdom and its relationship with users
        SGF -> HKR;
        SGF -> GMR;
        PTN -> NOB;
        BTR -> NOB;

        // My fun title
        labelloc=t;
        label=<<B>Kingdom Danger:</B> Fun times!>;
    }

Definitely nothing to write home about.
