## Mental programming

In a perfect world, our computer interactions would be entirely mental. Thoughts could translate directly into instructions, generating programs at the speed of our brains. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect. Technologists have designed many physical interfaces with computers, but a direct mental connection is not one of them. Some - motion detection, voice recognition, pressure pads - are fun. Others - the mouse and touchscreen - are functional. Only one - the classic, rugged keyboard - approaches the perfect world of mental programming.

## Freeing the mind through keyboarding

A physical keyboard is of constant size, shape, and texture. Without visual distraction or mental strain, seasoned [touch typists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) can transfer high-level thoughts to computers at something close to their speed of thought.

**Q**: *But what about the mouse?*  
**A**: When using the mouse, you must focus on the screen's changing layout. This causes mental strain over an extended period. Also, who wants to be one of those hobbled mouse users, hunched over their keyboard with that signature squint. Keyboard masters always look more refined than their mouse-driven compatriots.

**Q**: *Isn't the touch screen a keyboard?*  
**A**: A touch screen can be a keyboard, but it can also be a movie. This functional ambiguity is absent from real keyboards. Also, personal opinion, but typing on a touchscreen just plain blows.

A well-wielded keyboard frees the mind to focus on more important problems than data entry. Poorly-wielded keyboards can be a distraction. When solving complex programming problems, distractions can be fatal to productive thinking. Uncomfortable chairs, check-ins about timesheet completion, and fire alarms can all wreak havoc on an otherwise logical train of thought. If your main interface with your machine is also a distraction, I'll pour one out for your overworked brain.

## Experts only, bro

A non-touch typist's opinion about a keyboard quality is worthless, much like a new tennis player's opinion about a tennis racket quality. If you cannot touch type, stop reading immediately and learn. Your software journey will prematurely stagnate if you fail to pick up this most basic skill. Using your two-finger technique, or whatever you use, enter **"learn touch typing"** in your search bar.  In three months, when you are competent with a keyboard, please continue on to the next section.

## The perfect keyboard

The perfect keyboard is the perfect companion. It should nestle your hands through every computer you use, every program you write, every email you render. Its ideal traits:

* QWERTY
* relatively standard symbol layout
* portable
* tactile
* durable
* customizable
* control key between left tab and shift
* key proximity to the home row
* no arrow keys
    * no arrow keys, no expectation of spreadsheet operation.
    * no expectation of shreadsheet operation, more programming

## The Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2 (HHKP2)

The HHKP2 is the perfect typing instrument for software development. It is small enough to accompany you anywhere, and its key layout is perfect for the touch typist. Its high price represents a commitment to pursuing your craft; a premium price for hardware is less painful when software is free.

This is actually all I will write about this keyboard. This post was mostly so I could get some basic thoughts about the importance of touch-typing in software development, and is not intended to be a full-fledged product review. Please note: I've tried many mechanical keyboards over the past couple years (with cherry MX red, blue, brown, razer green and orange, buckling spring, etc). The HHKP2 represents my favorite typing experience.
