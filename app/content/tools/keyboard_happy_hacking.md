tool: Happy Hacking Keyboard (professional 2)

The Happy Hacking Keyboard (professional 2) is the perfect typing instrument for software development. The switches are amazing and its non-standard layout prevents others from requiring you to waste time on manipulating requiring arrow keys. It is small enough to accompany you anywhere, and its key layout is perfect for the touch typist. Finally, its price represents a commitment to pursuing your craft; paying for hardware is ok because all of your software is going to be free.
