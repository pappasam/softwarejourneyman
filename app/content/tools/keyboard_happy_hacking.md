## Mental programming

In a perfect world, our computer interactions would be entirely mental. Thoughts would translate directly into instructions, generating programs at the speed of thought. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect. Technologists have designed many physical interfaces with computers, but a direct mental connection is not one of them. Some - motion detection, voice recognition, pressure pads - are fun. Others - the mouse and touchscreen - are functional. Only one - the classic, rugged keyboard - approaches the perfect world of mental programming.

## Freeing the mind through keyboarding

A physical keyboard is of constant size, shape, and texture. Without visual distraction or mental strain, seasoned [touch typists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) can transfer high-level thoughts to computers at something close to their speed of thought.

* Q: *But what about the mouse?*
* A: Not true. Every interaction relies on a combination of senses, and coordinating these senses strains your brain
* Q: *Isn't the touch screen a keyboard?*
* A: A touch screen can be a keyboard, but it can also be a movie. Your brain cannot assume it will always be a keyboard, and your fingers cannot differentiate between **A** and **B**

A well-wielded keyboard frees the mind to focus on more important problems. Poorly-wielded keyboards can be a distraction. When solving complex programming problems, distractions can be fatal to productive thinking. Uncomfortable chairs, check-ins about timesheet completion, fire alarms can all wreak havoc on an otherwise logical train of thought. If your main interface with your machine is also a distraction, I'll pour one out for your overworked brain.

## Touch-typists only

A non-touch typist's opinion about a keyboard is worthless, much like a new tennis player's opinion about his tennis racket. If you cannot touch type, stop reading immediately and go learn. There are many good online resources. Using your two-finger technique (or whatever you use), enter **"learn touch typing"** in your search bar. When you are able to touch type, please continue on to the next section.

## The perfect keyboard

The perfect keyboard is the perfect companion. It should nestle your hands through every computer you use, every program you write, every email you render. Its ideal traits:

* portable
* tactile
* durable
* customizable
* standard

## The Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2 (HHKP2)

The HHKP2 is the perfect typing instrument for software development. It is small enough to accompany you anywhere, and its key layout is perfect for the touch typist. Its high price represents a commitment to pursuing your craft; a premium price for hardware is less painful when software is free.

This is actually all I will write about this keyboard. This post was mostly so I could get some basic thoughts about the importance of touch-typing in software development, and is not intended to be a full-fledged product review at this time. Please note: I've tried many mechanical keyboards over the past couple years (with cherry MX red, blue, brown, razer green and orange, buckling spring, etc). The HHKP2 represents my favorite typing experience.
