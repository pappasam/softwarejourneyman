## Executive summary

The Happy Hacking Keyboard (professional 2) is the perfect typing tool for software development. The switches are amazing, and its non-standard layout prevents others from requiring you to waste time on manipulating requiring arrow keys. It is small enough to accompany you anywhere, and its key layout is perfect for the touch typist. Finally, its price represents a commitment to pursuing your craft.
