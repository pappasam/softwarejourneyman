<h1>Software Journeyman</h1>

<h3><em>Journeyman</em></h3>
<p><em>an individual who has completed an apprenticeship and is fully educated in a trade or craft, but not yet a master.</em>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Come inside, traveler. Sheath your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard">membrane keyboard</a>, meditate upon your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat">bloated operating system</a>, and rest your weary fingertips. When using community-driven software, you are always among friends.

<h2>Why this blog?</h2>
<p>Community-driven software is both flexible and diverse in its offerings. These traits cause novice programmers to struggle with tool selection, comprehension, and usage.</p>
<h3>Core questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Given the sheer number of options, is there a "right" tool?</li>
    <li>When a "holy grail" tool is found, what are its quirks?</li>
    <li>Once the tool's quirks are ironed, how do I handle my team's quirks?</li>
</ol>
<p>This blog exists mostly to answer the first question. Since my target audience is the early journeyman, I will treat my subject matter as "black and white" as possible. There are nuances to my tool selection, but discussing those them here may confuse the reader. I have tried many tools before settling on one in the list, and will avoid writing about tools I do not understand. The second topic exists so others can avoid bugs I spend hours finding. The third gives me the opportunity to write about working with people. This may not see too much action, but it's there in case I get the urge.</p>
